Project Title: Diamond Price Prediction
Project Overview:
This project involves predicting the price of diamonds based on various attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and measurements (x, y, z). The dataset used for this project contains information about diamonds and their respective features, and the goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a diamond given these features. Different regression models have been implemented and evaluated, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and others, to identify the most accurate and robust model for price prediction.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to predict the price of a diamond based on its characteristics. This is achieved by applying different data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models. The project demonstrates the power of regression techniques in predicting continuous values like price, which is influenced by various factors such as the size, cut, color, and clarity of the diamond.

Key Features:
Carat: The weight of the diamond.
Cut: The quality of the diamond’s cut (e.g., Ideal, Premium, etc.).
Color: The color grade of the diamond (from D to J).
Clarity: The clarity grade (e.g., IF, VVS1, VVS2).
Depth: The depth percentage of the diamond.
Table: The width of the diamond's top facet.
x, y, z: The 3D dimensions of the diamond.
Data Preprocessing:
Data Cleaning: Missing values were handled and redundant data points were removed to ensure the quality of the data.
Feature Encoding: Categorical variables such as cut, color, and clarity were encoded using mapping techniques to convert them into numerical values for machine learning algorithms.
Feature Scaling: The dataset was scaled to bring all features into similar ranges, improving model performance.
Data Exploration: Visualizations and statistical analysis were conducted to understand the relationship between different features and the target variable (price).
Models Used:
Linear Regression: A basic regression model used to predict the price based on linear relationships between features and target.
Decision Tree Regression: A non-linear model that splits the data into smaller sections based on feature values, making it capable of modeling more complex relationships.
Random Forest Regression: An ensemble learning model that creates multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Other Models: Various other regression models were explored to assess their performance in predicting diamond prices.
Evaluation Metrics:
The models were evaluated based on standard metrics like:

R-squared (R²): Measures how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Indicates the average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Provides a measure of how spread out the residuals are, giving an idea of the model’s accuracy.
Results:
Among all the models tested, Random Forest Regression provided the most accurate and reliable predictions, outperforming other models such as Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression. The final model was able to predict diamond prices with a high degree of accuracy, making it a strong tool for price forecasting in the diamond industry.

Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict diamond prices based on key attributes. By leveraging multiple regression models and performing thorough exploratory analysis, the project offers insights into which features most significantly affect the price and how to accurately predict it.
